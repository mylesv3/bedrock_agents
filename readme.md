# AI Workflow w/ AWS

## Overview
This lab is a multi-agent workflow built in AWS Bedrock, and it is deployed using API Gateway and Postman. This workflow acts as a travel advisor that contains three agents: a supervisor agent, an accommodation agent, and a restaurant agent. Based on the user input, the supervisor agent will know which other agent to invoke for a response (accommodation or restaurant).
